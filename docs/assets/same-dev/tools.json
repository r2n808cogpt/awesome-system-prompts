This tool will return one preview URL of the version and one main URL.\nNetlify accepts either static or dynamic site deployments. Deploying static sites is much faster. If the project have a database, backend, or api routes, deploy it as a dynamic site.\nIMPORTANT: To deploy a nextjs static site, read the `next.config.js` file and make sure it includes `output: 'export'` and `distDir: 'out'`.\nTo deploy a dynamic site, read the `netlify.toml` file and make sure the [build] section is set to the correct build command and output directory set in the project's `package.json` file. If your project uses remote images, write the `[images]` section in the file with remote_images set to an array of URLs that you want to use.\nDo not edit the `netlify.toml` file for static sites.\nIf deploying as a static site fails, try redeploying the project as a dynamic site.\nYou MUST ALWAYS use the exact parameters 'zip -rFS' (e.g. 'zip -rFS ../../output.zip .'). The -rFS flags are critical: they create a fresh archive, recursively include all files, and properly handle special cases.",
