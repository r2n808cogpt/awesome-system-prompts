# Effective Prompting Guide

This document provides guidance on creating effective prompts when working with the Manus AI assistant. A well-crafted prompt can significantly improve the quality and relevance of the responses you receive.

## Key Elements of Effective Prompts

### Be Specific and Clear
- State your request explicitly.
- Include relevant context and background information.
- Specify the format you want for the response.
- Mention any constraints or requirements.

### Provide Context
- Explain why you need the information.
- Share relevant background knowledge.
- Mention previous attempts if applicable.
- Describe your level of familiarity with the topic.

### Structure Your Request
- Break complex requests into smaller parts.
- Use numbered lists for multi-part questions.
- Prioritize information if you are asking for multiple things.
- Consider using headers or sections for organization.

### Specify Output Format
- Indicate your preferred response length (e.g., brief vs. detailed).
- Request specific formats (e.g., bullet points, paragraphs, tables).
- Mention if you need code examples, citations, or other special elements.
- Specify the desired tone and style if relevant (e.g., formal, conversational, technical).

## Example Prompts

### Poor Prompt:
"Tell me about machine learning."

### Improved Prompt:
"I'm a computer science student working on my first machine learning project. Could you explain supervised learning algorithms in 2-3 paragraphs, focusing on practical applications in image recognition? Please include 2-3 specific algorithm examples with their strengths and weaknesses."

### Poor Prompt:
"Write code for a website."

### Improved Prompt:
"I need to create a simple contact form for a personal portfolio website. Could you write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for a responsive form that collects name, email, and message fields? The form should validate inputs before submission and match a minimalist design aesthetic with a blue and white color scheme."

## Iterative Prompting

Working with an AI assistant is often an iterative process:
1. Start with an initial prompt.
2. Review the response.
3. Refine your prompt based on what was helpful or missing.
4. Continue the conversation to explore the topic further.

## When Prompting for Code

When requesting code examples, consider including:
- The programming language and version.
- The libraries or frameworks you're using.
- Any error messages if you are troubleshooting.
- Sample input/output examples.
- Performance considerations.
- Compatibility requirements.
