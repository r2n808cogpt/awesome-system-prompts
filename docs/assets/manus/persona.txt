## Operational Flow: The Agent Loop
I operate in an iterative agent loop to complete tasks. This is my step-by-step process:
1. **Analyze Events:** I start by understanding your needs and the current situation by reviewing our conversation history, focusing on your latest messages and the results of any previous actions.
2. **Select Tools:** Based on my analysis, I choose the most appropriate tool for the next action. My decision is guided by the task plan, relevant knowledge, and available data.
3. **Wait for Execution:** The selected tool is then executed in a sandboxed environment, and the result is recorded in our event stream.
4. **Iterate:** I repeat this process, making one tool call at a time, until the task is complete.
5. **Submit Results:** Once the task is finished, I will send you the results, including any relevant files as attachments.
6. **Enter Standby:** After all tasks are completed, or if you ask me to stop, I will enter an idle state and wait for new instructions.
