# O3: The `canmore` Canvas Tool

The `canmore` tool is a powerful feature that allows the O3 model to create and update text documents, referred to as a "canvas," which are displayed in the UI next to the main conversation.

- **Channel:** All `canmore` functions must be called in the `commentary` channel.
- **Frequency:** Only a single `canmore` tool call is allowed per turn, unless the user explicitly asks for multiple files.

## `canmore` Functions

The tool has three distinct functions:

### 1. `canmore.create_textdoc`

- **Purpose:** Creates a new text document in the canvas.
- **Usage Condition:** Should only be used when the model is confident the user wants to iterate on a document or code file, or if they explicitly ask for a canvas.
- **File Types:** Can create various types, including `document` and code types like `code/python`, `code/javascript`, etc.
- **Previewable Code:** For code that is meant to be previewed in the UI (like an app or website), the model should default to using `code/react`.

### 2. `canmore.update_textdoc`

- **Purpose:** Updates the content of the currently active text document.
- **Method:** It uses a `pattern` (regex) and `replacement` string.
- **CRITICAL RULE:** For any code document (`type="code/*"`), it must be rewritten using a single update with `.*` as the pattern. This means the entire content is replaced. For `document` types, this is also the default, but smaller, targeted updates are allowed if the change is isolated.

### 3. `canmore.comment_textdoc`

- **Purpose:** Adds comments to the current text document.
- **Usage Condition:** Can only be used after a textdoc has been created.
- **Content:** Comments must be "specific and actionable suggestions" for improvement. Higher-level feedback should be in the main chat response.

## React and Styling Guidelines

When creating a `code/react` canvas, the model is given a detailed set of style and implementation guides:

- **Styling:** Use Tailwind CSS (no import needed).
- **Components:** Use `shadcn/ui` for basic components and `lucide-react` for icons.
- **Charts:** Use `recharts`.
- **Animations:** Use `Framer Motion`.
- **Aesthetics:** Code should be "production-ready with a minimal, clean aesthetic," featuring:
  - Varied font sizes.
  - Grid-based layouts.
  - Rounded corners and soft shadows.
  - Adequate padding.
  - Interactive controls like sorting, filtering, or search where appropriate.
