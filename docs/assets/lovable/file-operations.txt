# Lovable: File Operation Commands

Lovable uses a specific set of XML-like tags to perform all file system and dependency management operations. These commands are the only way it is permitted to modify the project's codebase.

## Core Commands

### `<lov-write>`

- **Purpose:** Creates a new file or completely overwrites an existing file.
- **Content:** The tag must contain the **complete** contents of the file. It does not support partial updates or patches.
- **Usage:**
  ```xml
  <lov-write path="src/components/NewComponent.tsx">
  // Full content of the new component file here
  </lov-write>
  ```

### `<lov-rename>`

- **Purpose:** Renames a file or directory.
- **Attributes:**
  - `path`: The original path of the file to be renamed.
  - `new_path`: The new path for the file.
- **Usage:**
  ```xml
  <lov-rename path="src/components/OldName.tsx" new_path="src/components/NewName.tsx" />
  ```

### `<lov-delete>`

- **Purpose:** Deletes a file from the project.
- **Attribute:**
  - `path`: The path of the file to be deleted.
- **Usage:**
  ```xml
  <lov-delete path="src/components/UnusedComponent.tsx" />
  ```

### `<lov-add-dependency>`

- **Purpose:** Installs a new package or updates an existing one to the project's dependencies.
- **Content:** The tag should contain the name of the package, optionally with a version.
- **Usage:**
  ```xml
