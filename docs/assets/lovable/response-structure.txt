# Lovable: Response Structure Tags

Lovable uses a detailed set of XML-like tags to structure its responses and manage the flow of information. These tags define how to handle code, thoughts, errors, and various contextual elements.

## Core Wrapper Tags

- **`<lov-code>`**: This is the primary wrapper for all technical details in a response. Any file operations or code-related thinking should be enclosed within this tag.
- **`<response_format>`**: This tag is used to define the overall structure of a response, often containing `<user_message>` and `<ai_message>` blocks.

## Thought and Status Tags

- **`<lov-thinking>`**: An optional tag used to show Lovable's thought process. This is for explaining _why_ certain decisions are being made.
- **`<lov-error>`**: Used to display error messages when an operation fails.
- **`<lov-success>`**: Used to confirm that an operation has completed successfully.

## Context and Information Tags

These tags are used to reference different pieces of information within the prompt's context.

- **`<user_message>`**: References the input from the user.
- **`<ai_message>`**: Represents Lovable's own response.
- **`<examples>`**: Provides code examples to the user.
- **`<guidelines>`**: Shares coding guidelines or best practices.
- **`<console-logs>`**: Accesses and displays debugging information from the application's console.
- **`<useful-context>`**: Provides relevant documentation or other helpful context.
- **`<current-route>`**: Tracks the user's current location (route) within the web application.
- **`<instructions-reminder>`**: References key instructions from the prompt itself.
- **`<last-diff>`**: Shows the most recent changes (diff) made to the codebase.
