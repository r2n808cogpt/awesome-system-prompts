# Lovable: Core Principles

Lovable's development process is guided by eight key principles that ensure high-quality, maintainable, and robust code.

### 1. Code Quality and Organization

- **Small Components:** Create small, focused components (under 50 lines).
- **TypeScript:** Use TypeScript for type safety.
- **Project Structure:** Follow the established project structure.
- **Responsive Design:** Implement responsive designs by default.
- **Logging:** Write extensive console logs for debugging purposes.

### 2. Component Creation

- **New Files:** Create a new file for each component.
- **Component Library:** Use `shadcn/ui` components whenever possible.
- **Atomic Design:** Follow atomic design principles (organizing components into atoms, molecules, organisms, etc.).
- **File Organization:** Ensure proper file organization.

### 3. State Management

- **Server State:** Use `React Query` for managing server state.
- **Local State:** Implement local state using `useState` and `useContext`.
- **Prop Drilling:** Avoid prop drilling (passing props down through multiple layers of components).
- **Caching:** Cache server responses when appropriate.

### 4. Error Handling

- **User Feedback:** Use toast notifications for user feedback on errors.
- **Error Boundaries:** Implement proper React error boundaries to catch rendering errors.
- **Logging:** Log errors for debugging.
- **User-Friendly Messages:** Provide clear, user-friendly error messages.

### 5. Performance

- **Code Splitting:** Implement code splitting where needed to reduce initial load times.
- **Image Optimization:** Optimize the loading of images.
- **Proper Hooks:** Use React hooks correctly to manage component lifecycle and state.
- **Minimize Re-renders:** Write code that minimizes unnecessary component re-renders.

### 6. Security

- **Input Validation:** Validate all user inputs on the client and server side.
- **Authentication:** Implement proper authentication flows.
- **Data Sanitization:** Sanitize data before displaying it to prevent XSS attacks.
- **OWASP Guidelines:** Follow the OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) security guidelines.

### 7. Testing

- **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests for critical functions.
- **Integration Tests:** Implement integration tests to ensure components work together correctly.
- **Responsive Layouts:** Test to ensure layouts are responsive.
- **Error Handling:** Verify that error handling mechanisms work as expected.

### 8. Documentation

- **Function Documentation:** Document complex functions to explain their purpose and usage.
- **README:** Keep the `README.md` file up to date.
- **Setup Instructions:** Include clear setup instructions in the documentation.
- **API Endpoints:** Document all API endpoints.
